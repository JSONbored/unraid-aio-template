# Recommended GitHub Settings

Apply these to every derived repo before it becomes public.

## General

- Keep the repo private until the container, docs, and Actions are validated
- Enable Issues and Discussions only if you plan to support them
- Disable Wikis and Projects unless you actively use them
- Add a social preview image before the repo goes public
- Set a clear About description and relevant GitHub topics
- Mark the GHCR package public only after the first successful publish
- Make sure the repo description clearly reflects the wrapped upstream app

## Branch Protection

Create a ruleset for `main`:

- require pull request before merge
- require status checks to pass before merge
- require signed commits
- require linear history
- block force pushes
- block branch deletion
- include administrators

Suggested required checks:

- `validate-template`
- `smoke-test`

## Actions

- Set `Workflow permissions` to `Read repository contents and packages`
- Enable `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` only if you explicitly want that
- Prefer `Allow select actions and reusable workflows`
- Allow GitHub-authored actions and verified creators
- Keep default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions minimal and only elevate inside jobs that publish
- Keep manual dispatch enabled so you can re-run validation or a controlled publish without making a noop commit
- Keep scheduled workflows enabled so upstream monitoring can run automatically

## Security

- Enable the dependency graph and GitHub vulnerability alerts
- Enable secret scanning
- Enable push protection
- Enable private vulnerability reporting
- Enable code scanning later if you add a relevant analyzer
- Use Renovate for update PRs instead of Dependabot update PRs

## Packages

- After the first successful publish, make the GHCR package public if the repo is public
- Verify the package name matches the intended CA XML repository value

## Secrets and Variables

Required variables:

- `ENABLE_AIO_AUTOMATION=true`
- `TEMPLATE_XML`
- `AWESOME_UNRAID_REPOSITORY`
- `AWESOME_UNRAID_XML_NAME`
- `AWESOME_UNRAID_ICON_NAME`

Optional variables:

- `IMAGE_NAME_OVERRIDE`
- `TEMPLATE_ICON_PATH`

Required secret:

- `SYNC_TOKEN`

## Maintenance

- install the Renovate GitHub App on each derived repo
- let Renovate manage pinned GitHub Action SHAs and Docker dependency updates
- review Renovate PRs manually before merging

## Derived Repo Checks Before Enabling Automation

- `template-aio.xml` has been renamed
- placeholder upstream image is gone
- upstream version is pinned explicitly instead of relying on a floating stable tag
- smoke test uses the real ready log line and real HTTP endpoint
- README no longer contains placeholder language
- XML points at the correct repo, icon, and support URLs
- `STRICT_PLACEHOLDERS=true bash scripts/validate-derived-repo.sh .` passes locally
- `upstream.toml` matches the real upstream app and update strategy
